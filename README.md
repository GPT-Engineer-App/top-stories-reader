# top-stories-reader

Create a page which shows me the top stories from Hacker News.

Take the latest stories from the Hacker News RSS and then display them in an easy to read list.

Make sure itâ€™s easy to read on mobile. Add dark mode too, in case I want to read at night.

I donâ€™t care about everything in Hacker News, so let me also enter domains to use to filter the list of stories.
